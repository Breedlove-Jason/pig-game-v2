# Pig Game v2

Welcome to Pig Game v2! This is a fun and simple dice game implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Game Rules

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their ROUND score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all their ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added to their GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
